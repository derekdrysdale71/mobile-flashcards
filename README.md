# React Nanodegree by Udacity
## Project 3: Mobile Flashcards

Mobile-Flashcards is the third project in the [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
It allows users to add flashcard sets called decks.  It also allows you to add cards to a deck.  These cards contain a question and answer.  You are then able to quiz yourself on these cards.  Notifications can be enabled to remind you study each day.

The project utilizes the following:
- redux and react-redux for state management
- react-navigate for navigation
- AsyncStorage for data persistence

This project has only been tested on iOS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
